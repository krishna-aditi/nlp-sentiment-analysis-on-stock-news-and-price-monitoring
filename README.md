NLP and Sentiment Analysis on Stock News and Price Monitoring
==============================

#### Overview
Stock market analysis is a difficult task to execute because of market volatility and a multitude of  other dependent and independent factors that influence the market value of a particular stock. One of these factors - investor sentiment, is very much capable of influencing the stock price. News and social media are few of the ways to capture it. We aim to bring together Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis of the stock related news to better understand the stock price trends.

#### Goals 
Goal is to create a platform with curated information about a company's profile, stock specific news (from 24 hours), and the stock price trend from the past year. We focus on summarizing the news using NLP models, and labeling it as positive or negative using sentiment analysis. The platform aims to help the user make informed trading decisions.

1. Create a workflow to web-scrape company specific information using YFinance library in Python
2. Build a Streamlit interface for the FastAPI to render stock price trends, company’s financials, and description of the business
3. Create an Airflow DAG to do the following:
4. Web-scrape company specific stock news with the help of NewsAPI and Newspaper3K API
5. Call the Summarization API (Lambda function) for summarization on each news article’s content
6. Call Sentiment Analysis API (Lambda function) for extracting the sentiment of each news article
7. Summarized news, along with the associated sentiment will be rendered on the Streamlit

#### Main Requirements
To test pretrained models and train API requires 
- Python 3.8
- pandas
- numpy
- Streamlit
- Python-jose
- Passlib
- Transformers 3.4
- Torch
- GCSFS
- Plotly
- Yfinance
- NewsAPI
- Newspaper3K

#### Use cases
1. Single hub for stock trends and associated news to help the investor to make informed decisions
2. Platform for learning about company stocks, or, stock  market analysis

#### Data
Following libraries will be potentially used to web-scrape data off Yahoo Finance:
1. yfinance 
2. BeautifulSoup (bs4)
3. news-api
4. newspaper3k

#### Process Outline
- FastAPI for data scraping for stock prices
- JWT Authentication for FastAPI
- Data scraping for stock news
- Dashboard creation using Google Data Studio
- Building lambda functions for news summarization 
- Building lambda functions for sentiment analysis
- Deploying Serverless lambda 
- Developing UI using Streamlit
- Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

#### Deployment Details:
1. Language: Python
2. Container: Docker, AWS ECR
3. Cloud ecosystems: AWS, Google cloud platform
4. Cloud tools: AWS Lambda, AWS Cloudwatch, AWS Gateway, GCP Cloud Storage, Google BigQuery, Google App Engine, Google DataStudio
5. Tools for analysis: Google Colab, Anaconda Spyder, Microsoft Azure Visual Studio
6. Other tools and frameworks: FastAPI, Pytest, Streamlit, Airflow
